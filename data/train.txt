Jeffrey O

Our O

that O

' O
' O
From O

perspective O
, O
India B-LOC
was O
a O
major O
source O
of O
the O
international O
spread O
of O
wild O

over O

decades O
… O

, O
also O
, O
there O
is O
no O
longer O
an O
excuse O
that O

cannot O
be O
eradicated O
. O

it O
can O

it O
can O

Dr O

' O
' O
The O

that O

Now O
very O

they O
are O
really O
looking O
at O

within O

' O

Just O
two O
years O

, O
experts O
were O
stating O
polio B-DIS
could O
never O
be O
eradicated O
from O
India B-LOC

In O
2009 O
, O
India B-LOC
accounted O
for O
half O
the O
world O
' O
s O
polio B-DIS
cases O
with O
741 O

The O
country O
is O
an O
ideal O
breeding O

for O
the O

with O
a O

' O

assistant O

Bruce O

the O

India B-LOC
moving O
towards O
being O
declared O

three O
years O
without O
an O

' O
' O
is O
a O
huge O
milestone O
which O
almost O
can O
' O
t O
be O
overstated O
' O
' O
. O

But O
he O
said O
the O
remaining O
endemic O
countries O
faced O
different O
challenges O
to O
India B-LOC
. O

In O
Nigeria O
, O
there O
remain O
pockets O
of O
resistance O
to O
the O
vaccine O
, O
in O
the O
belief O
it O
causes O
infertility O
, O
while O
the O
violence O
in O
Afghanistan O

Pakistan O
means O
vaccinators O
can O
' O
t O
safely O
get O
to O
children O
, O
particularly O
those O
who O
live O
in O
restive O
border O
areas O
. O

But O
Dr O

said O
another O
country O

perhaps O
another O

could O
be O

pointing O
out O
that O
it O

at O

doses O
to O
bring O
down O
the O

, O
along O

. O

In O
a O
formal O
message O
to O
all O
parents O
, O
the O
College O
of O
Paediatricians O
said O
, O
“ O
it O
is O
well O
documented O
that O

who O
have O

these O

have O
a O
greater O
potential O
to O

and O
advised O

to O
refrain O
from O

. O

Explaining O
that O

with O
a O
large O
number O

( O

, O
Prof O

Fernando O
said O
it O
had O
been O
noted O
that O
some O
of O
these O
children O
had O
received O
these O
medications O
before O
admission O
to O

. O

These O
drugs O
( O
NSAIDs O
) O
are O
available O
in O
the O
market O
under O
different O
trade O
names O
. O

Hence O
it O
is O
important O
to O
check O
the O
labels O
of O
all O
medications O
available O
for O
control O
of O
fever O
, O
prior O
to O
giving O
them O
to O
your O

she O
said O
. O

Echoing O
the O
views O
of O
the O
paediatricians O
, O
an O
Epidemiology O
Unit O
official O
said O
parents O
should O
not O
panic O
and O
dose O
the O
child O
with O
these O
common O
pain O
relieving O
drugs O
. O

“ O
It O
is O
essential O
to O
rule O
out O
dengue B-DIS
whenever O
a O
child O
has O
fever O
, O
” O
the O
official O
said O
, O
explaining O
that O
the O
fever O
is O
only O
a O
symptom O
of O
the O
disease O
. O

Referring O
to O
the O
harmful O
effects O
of O
giving O
pain O
relieving O
drugs O
if O
the O
child O
is O
having O
dengue B-DIS
, O
the O
official O
said O
such O
drugs O
might O
erode O
the O
lining O
of O
the O
stomach O
. O

By O
nature O
, O
these O
medications O
also O
have O
anti O
clotting O
properties O
. O

As O
such O
NSAIDs O
in O
any O
form O
, O
be O
it O
tablets O
, O
liquids O
, O
suppositories O
or O
injections O
, O
should O
not O
be O
given O
for O
fever O
as O
dengue B-DIS
is O
raising O
its O
head O
once O
again O
, O
the O
official O
said O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
senior O
Consultant O
Paediatrician O
, O
Dr O
. O
LakKumar O
Fernando O
who O
is O
also O
a O
dengue B-DIS
specialist O
said O
that O
looking O
at O
the O
trend O
last O
year O
, O
usually O
among O
those O
affected O
by O
dengue B-DIS
about O
50 O
% O
would O
be O
children O
. O

Last O
year O
, O
among O
the O
dengue B-DIS
deaths O
, O
one O
third O
comprised O
children O
and O
two O
third O
adults O
. O

Adding O
his O
voice O
to O
the O
serious O
concerns O
expressed O
over O
the O
use O
of O
NSAIDs O
when O
dengue B-DIS
is O
rampant O
, O
he O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
guidelines O
for O
dengue B-DIS
management O
formally O
introduced O
by O
the O
Health O
Ministry O
in O
December O
2010 O
specifically O
advised O
against O
their O
use O
. O

If O
any O
child O
has O
fever O
, O
the O
first O
assumption O
should O
be O
that O
it O
is O
dengue B-DIS
, O
as O
this O
viral O
disease O
is O
now O
hyper O
endemic O
in O
Sri B-LOC
Lanka I-LOC
, O
he O
says O
. O

A O
few O
years O
ago O
if O
we O
saw O
10 O
children O
with O
fever O
, O
about O
2 O
3 O
would O
be O
dengue B-DIS
patients O
. O

But O
now O
in O
Colombo B-LOC
, O
of O
10 O
children O
with O
fever O
, O
we O
should O
suspect O
that O
five O
have O
dengue B-DIS
, O
while O
in O
Negombo B-LOC
it O
would O
be O
as O
high O
as O
eight O
, O
said O
Dr O
. O
Fernando O
who O
is O
based O
in O
Negombo B-LOC
. O

Being O
part O
of O
a O
team O
which O
has O
studied O
dengue B-DIS
management O
not O
only O
in O
Thailand O
but O
also O
helped O
implement O
such O
measures O
in O
Pakistan O
recently O
, O
he O
said O
that O
when O
called O
upon O
to O
advise O
paediatricians O
all O
over O
the O
country O
on O
managing O
very O
ill O
children O
he O
had O
come O
across O
many O
who O
had O
bled O
due O
to O
being O
given O
either O
ibuprofen O
or O
mefenamic O
acid O
before O
admission O
to O
hospital O
. O

“ O
When O
dengue B-DIS
is O
around O
us O
, O
don’t O
give O
NSAIDs O
to O
bring O
down O
the O
fever O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
even O
though O
fever O
could O
be O
a O
distressing O
symptom O
and O
parents O
may O
look O
for O
quick O
relief O
. O

For O
, O
NSAIDs O
would O
then O
do O
more O
harm O
than O
good O
. O

Explaining O
that O
dengue B-DIS
patients O
die O
due O
to O
prolonged O
shock O
, O
fluid O
overload O
or O
massive O
bleeding O
, O
Dr O
. O
Fernando O
added O
the O
cause O
of O
death O
in O
a O
large O

of O
