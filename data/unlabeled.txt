fungus U

fungal U

It U

the U
infectious U
stage U
It U

colonizes U
skin U
cells U
of U
adult U
amphibians U
and U

of U

Infection U
occurs U
when U

Through U
mechanisms U
that U

moves U
from U
the U

of U
the U
skin U
to U
the U
stratum U
granulosum U
of U

epidermis U
and U
matures U
in U
the U

There U
it U
enters U

into U

The U
mechanism U
by U
which U
this U

causes U

seems U
to U
be U
by U
interference U
with U

to U

failureWorldwide U
amphibian U
decline U
has U
been U
related U
to U
epidemics U
caused U
by U
the U
chytrid U
fungus U
One U
hypothesis U
to U
explain U
the U
global U
amphibian U
decline U
is U
that U
the U
chytrid U
fungus U
acts U
as U
a U
propagating U
pathogen U
that U
was U
taken U
out U
of U
Africa U
by U
wildlife U
trade U
of U
_ U
Xenopus U
_ U
spp U
However U
evidence U
indicates U
that U
this U
fungus U
is U
not U
the U
single U
cause U
of U
the U

worldwide U
amphibian U
decline U
it U
is U
not U
necessary U
nor U
sufficient U
to U
cause U
population U
declines U
Prevalences U
to U
various U
pathogens U
other U
than U
chytrid U
fungus U
were U
greater U
in U
declining U
amphibian U
populations U
than U
in U
nondeclining U
ones U
an U
indication U
that U
pathogens U
are U
affecting U
amphibian U
populations U
as U
it U
is U
also U
reported U
hereIt U
has U
been U
shown U
that U
global U
warming U
can U
degrade U
toads U
condition U
and U
that U
frog U
declines U
caused U
by U
the U
chytrid U
fungus U
were U
preceded U
by U
periods U
of U
increasing U
stress U
an U
indication U
that U
poor U
condition U
is U
implicated U
in U
population U
declines U
In U
addition U
it U
was U
found U
that U

the U
severity U
of U
the U
infection U
by U
chytrid U
depends U
on U
the U
vigour U
of U
the U
individual U
infected U
Moreover U
amphibians U
have U
also U
declined U
in U
areas U
where U
the U
fungus U
is U
absent U
and U
the U
fungus U
is U
sometimes U
present U
for U
long U
periods U
of U
time U
without U
causing U
disease U
Thus U
an U
impoverished U
condition U
resulting U
from U
environmental U
changes U
may U
be U
triggering U
vicious U
circles U
in U
which U
the U
chytrid U
fungus U
may U
be U
implicated U
that U
are U
decimating U
amphibian U
populations U
Fortunately U
there U

that U
the U

amphibian U
decline U
has U

it U

However U
we U

is U

Distinction U
from U
reactivation U
of U
chronic U
hepatitis U
B U
is U
sometimes U
difficult U
since U
patients U
with U
chronic U
hepatitis U
B U
often U
have U
7S U
IgM U
antiHBc U
vs U
19S U
circulating U
in U
their U
blood U
prior U
to U
reactivation U
that U
is U
below U

limit U
of U
the U
IgMspecific U

antiHBc U
assay U
which U
begins U
at U
a U

When U
they U
undergo U
a U
reactivation U
of U
the U
disease U
however U
the U

level U
increases U

becomes U

Children U
often U
care U
for U
domestic U
poultry U
by U
feeding U
them U
cleaning U

Children U
may U
also U
have U

them U

and U
also U

and U
are U
at U
high U
risk U
because U
they U
like U
to U
play U
where U

are U
found U
I U
urge U
parents U
and U

to U
keep U
children U
away U
from U
sick U
or U
dead U
poultry U
and U
prevent U
them U
from U
playing U
with U
chickens U

must U
also U
make U
sure U
children U
thoroughly U
wash U
their U
hands U
with U

water U
before U

after U
any U

If U

their U

should U
seek U
medical U
attention U
at U
the U
nearest U

the U

our U
approach U
in U
the U
context U
of U
an U

where U

We U

Estimates U

The U

however U
due U
to U
relatively U

a U

which U
is U
consistent U
with U
a U
reduction U
in U

associated U
with U
the U

of U

Although U

the U

Although U

due U

all U

a U
low U

Continued U
monitoring U
of U
the U

potential U
of U
AH7N9 U
is U
critical U
in U
the U
coming U
months U
as U
intervention U
measures U

201308091872008The U

Cairo U

Thus U
it U
is U
unclear U
where U

Considering U
the U
similar U

from U

it U

The U

a U

on U

a U

In U

for U

Thus U
MERSCoV U

can U
be U

However U
they U
may U

There U

of U
malathion U
for U

When U

is U
classified U
as U
slightly U

toxic U
and U
carries U
the U
signal U
word U
caution U
on U
the U
label U
The U
acute U
effects U
of U
malathion U
depend U
on U
product U
purity U
and U
the U
vehicle U
of U
administration U
Thus U
the U
LD50 U
median U

3321 U
mgkg U
for U

Several U
other U
factors U
also U
affect U
the U
toxicity U
of U
the U
pesticide U
For U
example U
the U
toxicity U
of U
malathion U
appeared U
to U
be U
strongly U
linked U
to U
the U
amount U
of U
protein U
in U
the U
diet U
of U
laboratory U
rats U
As U
protein U
intake U
decreased U
malathion U
was U
increasingly U
toxic U

to U
the U
rats U
Malathion U
has U
been U
shown U
to U
have U
different U
toxicities U
in U
male U
and U
female U
rats U
and U
humans U
due U
to U
metabolism U
storage U
and U
excretion U
differences U
between U
the U
sexes U
For U
humans U
the U
lowest U
dose U
at U
which U
lethal U
effects U
have U
been U
observed U
was U
nearly U
3 U
times U
higher U
for U
males U
than U
for U

Acute U
symptoms U
in U
humans U
include U
nausea U
headache U
tightness U
in U
the U

and U
other U
symptoms U
typical U
of U
acetyl U

Unconsciousness U

are U
also U
typical U
of U

originally U
reported U
the U

for U
the U

but U
said U
that U
many U
questions U
remained U

because U
a U
perfect U

only U

out U

it U

Dr U

with U

that U

it U

picked U
it U
up U
that U
way U

Dr U

that U
it U
would U
definitely U

Experimentation U
on U

still U
has U
to U

conducted U
because U
the U

Susan U
said U
adding U
that U
the U
infectivity U
of U
the U

in U
both U

has U
to U
be U
assessedHowever U
Tunghai U
University U
life U

Lin U
Liangkong U
has U
suggested U
the U
opposite U
He U
said U
that U
following U
the U
news U
about U
the U
rabiesinfected U
puppy U
a U
group U
of U
researchers U
have U
been U
considering U
the U
possibility U
based U
on U
studies U
and U
observation U
that U
bats U

are U
the U
reservoir U
host U
of U
the U
rabies U
virus U
while U
ferretbadgers U
are U
just U
the U
victims U
There U
is U
no U
need U
for U
testing U
on U
dogs U
Lin U
said U
adding U
that U
healthy U
ferretbadgers U
should U
be U
captured U
to U
see U
whether U
they U
are U
infected U
with U
rabiesLin U
said U
ferretbadgers U
would U
be U
proven U
innocent U
as U
in U
not U
being U
the U
reservoir U
host U
of U
the U
virus U
if U
found U
with U
no U
virusBats U
belonging U
to U
genera U
_ U
Eptesicus U
_ U
and U
_ U
Myotis U
_ U
have U
been U
confirmed U
in U
the U
US U
to U
be U
the U
reservoir U
host U
or U
carrying U
rabies U
virus U
without U
exhibiting U
symptoms U
according U
to U
LinBats U
of U
both U

genera U
can U
be U
found U
in U
Taiwan U
There U
are U
7 U
species U
of U
_ U
Myotis U
_ U
bats U
in U
the U
country U
Lin U
saidThe U
bats U
living U
in U
forests U
or U
flying U
around U
can U
easily U
elude U
surveillance U
and U
their U
numbers U
are U
difficult U
to U
estimate U
It U
is U
possible U
that U
the U
virus U
had U
spread U
to U
ferretbadgers U
through U
the U
food U
chain U
Lin U
saidIf U
a U
bat U
weakened U
by U
the U
virus U
falls U
to U
the U
ground U
and U
its U
body U
is U
then U
eaten U
by U
a U
ferretbadger U
the U
latter U
would U
be U
running U
around U
with U
the U
virus U
and U
spreading U
it U
among U
its U
population U
Lin U
saidAs U
the U
genetic U
sequence U
has U
shown U
that U
the U

virus U
strain U
found U
in U
Taiwan U
has U
evolved U
independently U
for U
more U
than U
50 U
years U
it U
is U
reasonable U
to U
assume U
that U
it U
did U
not U
evolve U
with U
ferretbadgers U
which U
did U
not U
exhibit U
symptoms U
or U
infect U
dogs U
until U
very U
recently U
Lin U
addedIt U
shows U
that U
ferretbadgers U
might U
be U
the U
victims U
rather U
than U
the U
reservoir U
host U
that U
has U
been U
carrying U

In U

the U
great U
majority U
of U

outbreaks U
during U
the U
1980s U
were U
attributed U
to U
the U
consumption U
of U
raw U

In U
Scotland U
a U
similar U
situation U
existed U
until U
the U
sale U
of U
unpasteurized U

was U
prohibited U
in U
1983 U
which U
led U
to U
a U

the U
mid20th U

the U
main U

These U

for U
debate U
which U
is U
primarily U

on U
the U

where U
often U

circulates U
Therefore U
the U
aim U
of U
this U

is U
to U
evaluate U
the U
risks U
and U
benefits U
related U
to U
the U
consumption U
of U
raw U

milk U
at U
one U

and U
to U
evaluate U

aspectsConclusionsIn U
this U
evaluation U
it U
is U
clearly U
demonstrated U
that U
the U
consumption U

of U
raw U
milk U
poses U
a U
realistic U
and U
unnecessary U
health U
threat U
because U
of U
its U
possible U
contamination U
with U
pathogenic U
bacteria U
It U
is U
therefore U
recommended U
to U
heat U
raw U
milk U
before U
consumption U
especially U
when U
served U
to U
young U
children U
pregnant U
women U
or U
any U
person U
suffering U
from U
a U
chronic U
disease U
or U
a U
suppressed U

In U
this U

the U
attention U
is U
drawn U
to U
raw U
milk U
provided U
on U

to U
the U
general U
public U

from U

to U
the U

From U
a U
nutritional U
point U
of U

infants U

milk U

The U
finding U
of U
hepadnaviruses U
in U
bats U
raise U
many U
interesting U
questions U
The U
1st U

is U
whether U
human U
HBV U
originated U
by U
infection U
with U
bat U
HBV U
either U
by U
consumption U
of U
bat U
meat U
or U
another U
mode U
of U
transmission U
How U
long U
ago U
this U
occurred U
is U
not U
known U
It U
has U
been U
suggested U
that U
HBV U
has U
been U
in U
humans U
for U
at U
least U
15 U
000 U
years U
Some U
avian U
species U
contain U
avihepadnaviral U
sequences U
integrated U
into U
their U
genome U
indicating U
that U
these U
viruses U
originated U
at U
least U
19 U
million U
years U
ago U
These U
findings U
also U
raise U
many U
questions U
about U
the U
pathogenesis U
of U
hepadnaviral U
infection U
in U
bats U
including U
the U
mode U
of U
transmission U
in U
humans U
the U
virus U
is U
transmitted U
by U
exposure U
to U
blood U

for U
example U
by U
injection U
or U
during U
childbirth U
and U
whether U
chronic U
infections U
can U
occur U
as U
they U
do U
in U
humansFinally U
it U
is U
interesting U
to U
consider U
the U
zoonotic U
potential U
of U
tentmaking U
bat U
HBV U
which U
can U
infect U
human U
cells U
Because U
bat U
hepadnaviruses U
are U
genetically U
distinct U
from U
HBV U
current U
serological U
and U
nucleic U
acid U
screening U
programs U
would U
not U
detect U
human U
infections U
The U
authors U
suggest U
that U
human U
and U
nonhuman U
primate U
sera U
from U
areas U
in U
which U
these U
bat U
viruses U
were U
isolated U
should U
be U
screened U
using U
assays U
that U
detect U
the U
bat U
hepadnaviruses U
Without U

use U

agent U
it U
is U
clearly U
uncertain U
as U

to U
the U
type U
of U
agent U
or U
the U

partySome U
of U
the U
videos U

are U
somewhat U
confusing U
Some U

large U

which U
is U

Nerve U
agents U

small U
pinpoint U
pupils U
and U
the U
appropriate U
treatment U
is U
atropine U
Both U
articles U
indicate U
a U
deficiency U
of U
atropine U
However U
if U
some U
of U
the U
videos U
showed U
victims U
of U

chemical U
agent U

after U

then U
the U
large U
dilated U

may U
be U

reports U
of U
1st U

are U
consistent U
with U

Other U
reports U
indicating U
that U
those U
in U
the U

basements U
were U
more U
severely U
affected U
Some U
chemical U

are U
heavier U
than U
air U
and U
may U
well U
settle U
into U
basements U
or U
low U

areasThe U
location U
is U
what U

inconsistent U
with U
these U

There U
are U
large U
numbers U
of U

The U

when U

were U

yet U
videos U
show U
victims U
fully U

in U

one U
has U
to U
wonder U
if U
this U
could U
have U
been U
a U
rebel U
group U
moving U
a U
newly U
developed U
agent U
when U
an U
accidental U
explosion U
occurred U
in U

this U
were U
the U
doing U
of U
Assad U

then U
the U
target U
of U
homes U

women U
and U
children U
would U
be U
more U
unlikely U
as U
it U
would U
bring U
down U
the U
wrath U
of U
an U
international U
community U
Or U
was U
the U
explosion U
from U
a U
rocket U
that U
was U
misdirected U
or U
erred U
off U
courseAnother U
alternative U
may U
be U
that U
terrorists U
not U
associated U
with U
the U
rebels U
or U
the U
Assad U
forces U
are U
looking U
to U
intensify U
the U
civil U
war U

possibly U
cause U

leading U
to U
an U
easier U
takeover U
by U
the U

of U
who U
claims U

it U

Signs U
are U

that U

that U

last U

The U

that U

in U
a U

of U

in U
Qatar U
linked U

2 U
recent U

cases U
This U
is U
a U
very U
important U
piece U
of U
the U
puzzle U
says U
Mike U
Osterholm U
director U
of U
the U
Center U
for U
Infectious U
Disease U
Research U
and U
Policy U
at U
the U
University U
of U

Twin U
Cities U
So U
far U
the U
virus U
has U
sickened U
160 U
people U
and U
killed U
68The U
finding U
was U
part U
of U
an U
investigation U
into U
2 U
patients U

from U
Qatar U
who U
both U
contracted U
MERS U
but U
survived U
Qatari U
officials U
took U
samples U
from U
the U
environment U
and U
numerous U
animals U
at U
the U
farm U
where U
the U
2 U
worked U
Researchers U
in U

Netherlands U
detected U
MERS U
coronavirus U
RNA U
in U
nose U
swabs U
from U
3 U
of U
the U
14 U
camels U
tested U
The U
scientists U
confirmed U
the U
result U
by U
sequencing U
a U
fragment U
of U
the U
virus U
Based U
on U
the U
length U
of U
the U
sequence U
we U
are U
absolutely U
certain U
that U
this U
is U
MERS U
says U
Marion U
Koopmans U
chief U
of U
virology U
at U
the U
National U
Institute U
for U
Public U
Health U
and U
the U
Environment U
in U
the U
Netherlands U
who U
was U
involved U
in U
the U

workScientists U
suspect U
bats U
as U
the U
ultimate U
source U
of U
the U
new U
virus U
but U
human U
interactions U
with U
bats U
are U
limited U
so U
another U
animal U
species U
may U
act U
as U
a U
bridge U
In U
August U
2013 U
Koopmans U
and U
other U
scientists U
reported U
that U
they U
had U
found U
antibodies U
against U
MERS U
coronavirus U
in U
50 U
out U
of U
50 U
camels U
from U
Oman U
They U
also U
tested U
sheep U
goats U
and U
cows U
but U
found U
no U
antibodies U
Whether U
the U
camels U
really U
were U
infected U
with U
MERS U
remained U
unclear U
however U
Earlier U
this U
month U
November U
2013 U
Saudi U
officials U
announced U
that U
a U
camel U
owned U
by U
a U
MERS U
patient U
had U
tested U
positive U

for U
MERS U
as U
well U
but U
they U
have U
not U
presented U
any U
sequence U
data U
to U
dateThe U
result U
from U
the U
Qatari U
camels U
does U
not U
prove U
that U
the U
virus U
is U
transmitted U
from U
camels U
to U
humans U
Infected U
humans U
could U
also U
have U
transmitted U
it U
to U
the U
camels U
and U
other U
animals U
may U
also U
be U
involved U
We U
have U
to U
be U
careful U
about U
assuming U
that U
this U
is U
just U
in U
camels U
says U
Osterholm U
If U
camels U
can U
be U
infected U
then U
its U
very U
likely U
that U
other U
domestic U
animals U
can U
be U
infected U
as U
well U
Virologist U
Ab U
Osterhaus U
who U
was U
involved U
in U
the U
work U
confirmed U
to U
ScienceInsider U
that U
other U
animals U
including U

pigeons U
chicken U
and U
sheep U
were U
being U
tested U
as U
well U
but U
did U
not U
want U
to U
discuss U
preliminary U
findings U
Researchers U
were U
also U
trying U
to U
piece U
together U
the U
whole U
viral U
sequence U
found U
in U
the U
camel U
samples U
he U
saidEven U
if U
they U
succeed U
and U
the U
link U
to U
camels U
is U
confirmed U
many U
questions U
about U
the U
outbreak U
remain U
open U
It U
is U
not U
clear U
for U
instance U
how U
many U
of U
the U
observed U
cases U
are U
linked U
to U
humantohuman U
transmissions U
and U
how U
many U
were U
animaltohuman U
Osterholm U
also U
points U
out U
that U
many U
mild U
cases U
in U

may U

Saudi U
Arabia U

praises U

for U

2013The U
viral U
fragments U
were U

Koopmans U
saidBut U
finding U
infected U
camels U
and U
infected U
people U
on U
the U

does U
not U
prove U
that U
the U
former U
transmitted U
the U

to U
the U
latter U
she U
saidIt U
is U
theoretically U
possible U
that U
the U
camels U

contracted U
the U
virus U
from U
the U
people U
2 U
men U
both U
of U
whom U
survived U
their U
brush U
with U
MERS U
Or U
some U
other U
animal U
or U
animals U
on U
the U

may U
have U
played U
a U
role U
in U
the U

dynamicHow U
they U
the U
camels U
got U
it U
and U
what U
the U
relationship U
to U

is U
that U
still U
remains U
open U
I U

what U
it U

us U
she U

Its U
still U
very U

I U

we U

the U
World U

is U
from U

there U
was U
a U
new U
coronavirus U
spreading U
on U
the U
Arabian U
Peninsula U
suspicion U
has U
often U
focused U
on U
camels U
That U
s U
because U
from U
time U
to U
time U
there U
have U
been U
reports U
that U
an U
infected U
person U
owned U
camels U
or U
attended U

races U
But U
the U
WHO U
says U
many U
of U
the U
people U
who U
have U
contracted U
this U
virus U
reported U
no U
contact U
with U
the U
beastsThe U
working U
hypothesis U
is U
the U
virus U
originated U
in U
bats U
as U
SARS U
likely U
did U
before U
it U
But U
people U
typically U
do U
nt U

have U
a U
lot U
of U
contact U
with U
bats U
and U
scientists U
have U
assumed U
some U
animal U
or U
animals U
is U
playing U
a U
bridging U
role U

MERS U
to U
peopleKoopmans U
and U

clue U
earlier U

To U
confirm U
that U

play U
a U
role U
in U
this U
story U
science U
needs U
evidence U
of U
current U

which U
is U
what U
the U
Qatar U

is U
reportingEarlier U
this U

November U

2013 U
the U
deputy U

said U
the U

will U
answer U
some U
questions U
but U
raises U
othersThis U
is U
our U
1st U
clue U
which U
further U
fills U
out U
the U
whole U

agreed U
Bart U

a U
Dutch U

As U
well U
he U
said U
the U
camels U
have U

to U

remains U
to U

discovered U
the U
key U
question U
the U
WHO U
would U
like U
to U

answered U
is U
how U

Haagmans U

But U
there U
are U
indications U
based U

experience U
with U

that U
H7N9 U
is U

the U
current U
understanding U
of U
the U
way U

countries U
and U
in U
addition U
to U
the U
economic U

H7N9 U
presents U
a U
serious U
public U

risk U
when U
there U

particularly U
during U

the U

The U
lack U
of U
any U

makes U

the U

at U

about U

about U
environmental U

There U

nt U
any U
evidence U
that U
eating U
wellcooked U

even U

poultry U
is U
dangerous U
the U
H7N9 U
virus U
is U
mostly U
found U
in U
the U
respiratory U

of U
infected U
poultry U
unlike U
the U
more U
systemic U
distribution U
of U
the U
H5N1 U

in U

The U
number U
of U

of U
H7N9 U
in U
China U
though U
not U

huge U
is U
growing U
faster U
than U
last U
year U
2013 U
and U
far U
faster U
than U
H5N1 U
And U
the U
available U
evidence U
strongly U
suggests U
that U
most U
victims U
are U
catching U
the U
virus U
from U
poultry U
or U
poultry U
environments U
such U
as U
live U
animal U
markets U

at U
most U
only U
occasionally U
from U
other U

The U

advises U

to U
China U
to U
avoid U

It U
is U
not U

for U
Chinese U
consumers U
to U
try U
to U
be U
as U
cautious U
as U
their U
foodpurchasing U
and U

This U
is U
especially U
true U
in U
the U
face U
of U
massive U
expert U

uncertainty U
about U
how U
this U
new U
virus U
behavesMore U
importantly U
the U
industrys U
recommendations U
are U
bound U
to U
backfire U
It U
is U
a U
fundamental U
principle U
of U
risk U
communication U
that U
mistrust U
arouses U
outrage U
In U
other U
words U
people U
become U
much U
more U
concerned U
about U
a U
health U
risk U
when U
they U
discover U
that U
they U
are U
not U
being U
told U
the U
whole U
truth U
about U
that U
risk U
When U
sources U
can U
not U

small U
risks U
look U
big U
and U
big U
risks U
look U
biggerIn U
their U
efforts U
to U
learn U
this U
lesson U
Chinas U
public U
health U
agencies U
have U
come U
far U
since U
the U
days U
when U
at U
least U
one U
hospital U
hid U
SARS U
patients U
in U
elevators U
and U
buses U
so U
visiting U
WHO U
doctors U

would U
nt U
find U
them U
In U
April U
2013 U
one U
week U
after U
reports U
of U
the U
1st U
human U
H7N9 U
bird U

cases U
in U
China U
Xinhua U
published U
an U
astonishing U
editorial U
Ten U
years U
after U
SARS U
what U
has U
China U
learned U
The U
very U
last U
line U
of U
that U
editorial U
bears U
repeating U
If U
there U
is U
anything U
that U
SARS U
has U
taught U
China U
and U
its U
government U
its U
that U
one U
can U
not U
be U
too U
careful U
or U
too U
honest U
when U
it U
comes U
to U
deadly U
pandemicsAs U
far U
as U
Western U
observers U
can U
tell U
China U
has U
been U
comparatively U
honest U
about U
H7N9 U
although U
some U
experts U
have U
expressed U
doubts U
about U
Chinas U
animal U
surveillance U
efforts U

So U
far U
Chinas U
H7N9 U
outbreak U
communication U
is U
perceived U
as U
vastly U
better U
than U
its U
performance U
during U
SARSAny U
effort U
to U
suppress U
or U
understate U
the U
risk U
of U
H7N9 U
or U
its U
link U
to U
poultry U
would U
reverse U
this U
progress U
and U
undermine U
trust U
The U
Chinese U
poultry U
industry U
is U
sending U
a U
pristinely U
clear U
signal U
that U
it U
considers U
industry U
wellbeing U
much U
more U
important U
than U
consumer U
wellbeing U
How U
could U
anyone U
trust U
such U
an U
industry U
to U
seek U
let U
alone U
reveal U
valid U
information U
about U
the U
potential U
risk U
to U
humansChinas U
animal U

officials U
risk U
destroying U
the U

hardearned U
improved U
reputation U
of U
Chinas U
public U

officials U
they U
are U
all U

officials U
in U
the U
eyes U
of U
most U
Chinese U
and U
they U
are U
all U
just U
China U
to U
the U
outside U
worldEven U
just U
lobbying U
for U
a U
coverup U
will U
surely U
diminish U
trust U
and U
confidence U
and U
exacerbate U
public U
and U
expert U
concern U
about U
H7N9 U
both U
domestically U
and U
worldwideMistrust U
of U
Chinese U
agriculture U
and U
food U
production U
is U
already U
extremely U
high U
fed U
by U
the U
melamine U
scandal U
see U
201009233445 U
and U
many U
other U
events U
This U
low U
trust U
is U
directly U
relevant U
to U
the U
basic U
H7N9 U
problem U
Live U
poultry U
and U
live U
bird U
markets U

appear U
to U
be U
the U
principal U
sources U
of U
human U
H7N9 U
infection U
If U
Chinese U
consumers U
liked U
and U
trusted U
frozen U
poultry U
their U
risk U
of U
infection U
would U
be U
far U
lower U
But U
precisely U
because U
they U
assume U
or U
know U
that U
sick U
birds U
are U
often U
sold U
into U
the U
food U
chain U
many U
Chinese U
consumers U
insist U
on U
inspecting U
the U
live U
bird U
before U
they U
buy U
it U
This U
contributes U
to U
the U
potential U
spread U
of U
infection U
in U
poultry U
and U
in U
humans U
as U
well U
as U
to U
individual U
consumers U
exposure U
and U
it U
makes U
it U
hard U
to U
permanently U
close U
live U
bird U
marketsIts U
not U
just U
in U
Asia U
that U
agricultural U
sources U
of U
risk U
information U
tend U
to U
be U
less U

candid U
than U
public U
health U
sources U
and U
therefore U
less U
trusted U
This U
is U
true U
in U
the U
West U
as U
well U
The U
food U
industry U
and U
the U
agricultural U
agencies U
of U
most U
governments U
have U
a U
structurally U
inherent U
conflict U
of U
interest U
when U
food U
threatens U
human U
health U
how U
much U
to U
protect U
the U
food U
consumer U
versus U
the U
food U
producer U
Public U
health U
agencies U
also U
sometimes U
have U
conflicts U
of U
interest U
but U
those U
are U
rarely U
inherent U
in U
their U
agencies U
mandatesDuring U
the U
pandemic U
of U
20092010 U
pig U
farmers U
and U
agricultural U
government U
agencies U
in U
the U
US U
and U
elsewhere U
pushed U
hard U
with U
some U
success U
to U
persuade U
public U
health U
agencies U
and U
even U
journalists U
to U
refer U
to U
the U
pandemic U
virus U
as U

H1N1 U
rather U
than U
swine U
flu U
Pig U
farmers U
in U
20092010 U
had U
a U
better U
case U
than U
Chinese U
poultry U
farmers U
have U
today U
Pandemic U
H1N1 U
had U
already U
adapted U
to U
human U
hosts U
and U
was U
already U
spreading U
in U
a U
sustained U
way U
from U
human U
to U
human U
by U
the U
time U
the U
first U
novel U
H1N1 U
viruses U
were U
identified U
in U
2 U
southern U
California U
children U
with U
no U
pig U
exposure U
The U
initial U
pigtohuman U
phase U
of U
H1N1s U
emergence U
passed U
unnoticed U
In U
April U
2009 U
H1N1 U
was U
a U
swine U
flu U
virus U
that U
had U
not U
yet U
been U
found U
in U
pigs U
but U
it U

was U
already U
spreading U
as U
a U
fully U
human U
flu U
virus U
By U
contrast U
this U
new U
H7N9 U
virus U
appears U
to U
be U
a U
fully U
avian U
virus U
So U
far U
it U
spreads U
to U
humans U
almost U
entirely U
from U
poultry U
or U
poultryladen U
environments U
Maddeningly U
that U
is U
what U
the U
Chinese U
poultry U
industry U
wants U
to U
cover U
upThe U
main U
thing U
wrong U
with U
calling U
H7N9 U
bird U
flu U
is U
that U
the U
virus U
has U
not U
yet U
been U
found U
in U
wild U
birds U
only U
in U
poultry U
So U
perhaps U
it U
is U
genuinely U
unfair U
to U
stigmatize U
all U
birds U
Instead U
of U
H7N9 U
bird U
flu U
we U
suggest U
that U
the U
virus U
be U
called U

H7N9 U
poultry U
flu U
or U
H7N9 U
live U
animal U
market U
flu U
more U
accurate U
labels U
Those U
names U
have U
an U
appropriate U
precautionary U
signal U
built U
into U
them U
The U
poultry U
industry U
would U
not U
find U
them U
preferable U
to U
H7N9 U
bird U
flu U
however U
see U
commentWhen U
trying U
to U
persuade U

about U
precautions U
the U
primary U

to U

the U

level U

that U
the U

If U

The U

The U

adjustment U
reaction U

to U

risk U
and U
its U
appetite U
for U
poultry U
will U
recover U
most U
quickly U
if U
officials U
are U
patient U
and U
empathic3 U
The U
Chinese U
public U
is U
overreacting U
in U
large U
measure U
because U
they U
mistrust U
what U
Chinese U

are U
telling U

from U

that U

and U
to U
offer U

for U

for U

Then U
and U

Thus U

that U

3 U

In U

was U
considered U
as U
nonthreatening U
and U
highly U

However U
the U
highincidence U

represented U
a U
peak U
with U
76 U

100131 U
of U
the U

during U

this U
stage U
Furthermore U
the U
3 U
spatiotemporal U
clusters U
of U

identified U
were U
all U
during U
this U
period U
Increased U
surveillance U
and U

should U
be U
carried U
out U
in U
this U
period U
in U
future U
to U
find U
out U
if U
there U
is U
an U

In U

to U
the U
ending U
of U
the U
outbreak U
in U
the U
most U
severely U
affected U
areas U
This U
is U
now U
believed U
to U
be U
mainly U
due U
to U
the U
closure U
of U
live U
poultry U
marketsSome U
studies U
have U
claimed U
that U
climatic U
factors U
particularly U
temperature U
have U
a U
clear U
impact U
on U
seasonal U
influenza U
outbreaks U
The U
weather U
in U
eastern U
China U
is U

very U
cold U
between U
December U
and U
January U
and U
temperatures U
begin U
to U
rise U
in U

It U
is U
usually U
relatively U
warm U
in U
March U

April U
and U

to U
get U
hot U
from U
May U
The U
temporal U
characteristics U
of U
human U
infections U
with U
influenza U
AH7N9 U
virus U
suggest U
that U
temperature U
has U
some U
association U
with U
incidence U
of U
this U
disease U
The U
prevailing U
mild U
climate U
may U
have U
been U
particularly U
suitable U
for U
influenza U
AH7N9 U
virus U
infection U
since U
there U
was U

there U

It U
is U
notable U
that U
when U
the U

in U
Beijing U

Henan U
there U
were U
no U

the U

for U
this U
Were U
the U
2 U
regions U

foci U
of U

Alternatively U
and U
perhaps U
more U
probable U
could U
they U
be U
attributed U
to U
the U
regional U
poultry U
trade U
or U
migration U
of U

wild U

These U
possibilities U
need U
to U
be U

3 U

Some U
studies U
report U
that U
the U
spatial U
distribution U
of U
human U
infection U
with U

AH5N1 U
is U
mainly U
associated U

poultry U

and U
the U
proportion U
